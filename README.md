## Software

The PiSight camera implements the [UVC standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_video_device_class) via the [Gadget API](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/usb/gadget.html), which turns the Raspberry Pi and camera into a plug-and-play USB webcam.

Simply install [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/) (the Lite version is enough) and then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxbbraun/pisight
cd pisight
sudo ./setup.sh
```
